# MileDIY

This App will allow its users to find gas in a selected radius of their location as
 well as giving them the price. They will be able to select the gas station they 
 would like to go to and the app will bring up a map to get them there. Aditianally
 the user will be able to track their gas mileage and how much money they have spent
 on their trip.

Further implementatin -

If I have the time I would like to add a feature where users can look up vehicles and 
get the average users gas mileage of the selected vehicle. This would be ever changing
as users add to it.


## Features

- Users can find gas near them without logging in
- Users can create an account
- Users can track their gas mileage
- Users can track their gas spendings
- Users can see their past trips
- Users can open a map that will take them to the selected gas station
